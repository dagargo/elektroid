## API

Elektroid is extensible and offers two extension points.

* Filesystems, which is a set of operations over MIDI and the computer filesystem to implement file uploading, downloading, renaming and the like. A device can implement several filesystems.
* Device menu actions, which are shown in the application menu and are meant to be device related configuration windows.
