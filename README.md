# Elektroid

Elektroid is a GNU/Linux sample transfer application for Elektron devices. It includes the `elektroid` GUI application and the `elektroid-cli` CLI application.
Elektroid has been reported to work with Model:Samples, Digitakt and Analog Rytm mk1 and mk2.

## Installation

As with other autotools project, you need to run the following commands.

```
autoreconf --install
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

The package dependencies for Debian based distributions are:
- automake
- libasound2-dev
- libgtk-3-dev
- libpulse-dev
- libsndfile1-dev
- libsamplerate0-dev
- libtool
- autopoint
- gettext
- zlib1g-dev

You can easily install them by running `sudo apt install automake libasound2-dev libgtk-3-dev libpulse-dev libsndfile1-dev libsamplerate0-dev libtool autopoint gettext zlib1g-dev`.

## CLI

`elektroid-cli` provides the same funcionality than `elektroid`. Provided paths must always be prepended with the device id and a colon (':'), e.g. `0:/samples`.
Here are the available commands.

* ld, list compatible devices

```
$ elektroid-cli ld
0 Elektron Digitakt MIDI 1
```

* info, show device info

```
$ elektroid-cli info 0
Digitakt 1.11
```

* ls

It only works for directories. Notice that the first column is the file type, the second is the size in MiB (it is the same unit used in the devices although it is showed there as MB), the third is an internal cksum and the fourth is the sample name.

```
$ elektroid-cli ls 0:/
D 0.00 00000000 incoming
F 0.09 3d71644d square
```

* mkdir

```
$ elektroid-cli mkdir 0:/samples
```

* rmdir

```
$ elektroid-cli rmdir 0:/samples
```

* upload

```
$ elektroid-cli upload square.wav 0:/
```

* download

```
$ elektroid-cli download 0:/square
```

* mv

```
$ elektroid-cli mv 0:/square 0:/sample
```

* rm

```
$ elektroid-cli rm 0:/sample
```
